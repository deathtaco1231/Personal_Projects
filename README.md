This is a personal repository containing folders of each project i have worked on/continue to work on and occasionally update. 
The Console Based Text Editor and Nucear Reactor SCADA were group projects from semesters 2 and 3 of my BCS Program career at Conestoga respectively,
though the projects were done in their near entierty by me, and many bug fixes/improvements have been and continue to be added.
